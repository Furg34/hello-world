# hello-world
My first repository.  Learning to code

I am brand new to coding as of May 1st 2017.

I've got a background in communications technology including a two year diploma.

My interests in coding have come and gone many times throughout my young life.  I enjoy working with computers and have the skills to connect, cofigure and impliment an entire office network but my coding knowledge is good enought to "echo" a 'hello-world' string.

This is my first "README" file inside my first repository.  I will now commit my changes to my MASTER!

Cheers!
